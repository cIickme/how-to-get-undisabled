(THIS IS GOING TO BE THE EMAIL YOU MAIL TO support@discordapp.com)

Hi! My name is [insert your name here] and I was going to talk to my friends on the app today when I apeared at
the login screen, I thought no worries I'll just log in until it says that my account has been disabled, I really
do not know what I have been disabled for and I am really sorry, you see I love discord and its platmore and I do not
intend to do anything against the terms of service on purpose, you see whatever I did it was a honest mistake and I am
sorry for it, if you just tell me what I did I will make sure it will never, and I mean NEVER happen again, thank you 
in advance.
